# README Generator

  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## Description
  This weeks challenge we were tasked with creating an app that will generate a README.md file using only the command line. By using Node.js, the user is given a series of prompts related to information in a typical professional README file. The user will see the questions in their command line and will input the data as they see fit. Once they have answered all the questions, a markdown file is created called SAMPLE_README with a table of contents created as well. 

  ## Table of Contents
  1. [Installation](##installation)
  2. [Usage](#usage)
  3. [Contributions](#contributions)
  4. [Questions](#questions)
  5. [License](#license)
